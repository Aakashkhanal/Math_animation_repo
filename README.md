# Math Animations with Manim  

This repository contains my learning journey with **Manim Community Edition (ManimCE)**.  
Here, I post the code and experiments I create while exploring how to animate mathematical concepts.  

## âœ¨ What youâ€™ll find here  
- Code for different math animations  
- Experiments with **positioning objects** (`next_to`, `shift`, `align_to`, `move_to`)  
- Applying **animations** to bring objects and equations to life  
- Step-by-step improvements as I continue learning  

## ðŸŽ¥ Purpose  
The goal of this repo is to:  
- Practice and improve my Manim skills  
- Document my learning process  
- Share reusable code snippets for anyone interested in mathematical animations  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started  

To run the code in this repo:
